            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Egg Yolks</li>
                <li>Pecorino Romano Cheese</li>
                <li>Pasta Cooking Water</li>
                <li>Black Pepper </li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To begin, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Next, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook it according to the package directions. It should be cooked to al dente, but not more. Then when the pasta is done cooking, set aside 2 cups of the hot pasta water and then drain the noodles in a colander.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, add the guanciale to a large saute pan and cook it over medium heat for a few minutes. You just want it to become soft and begin releasing fat. You do not want the guanciale to become hard so keep an eye on it to prevent overcooking.</li>
                <li>Next, whisk the egg yolks, freshly ground black pepper, and almost all of the grated cheese together in a medium bowl. Then add 1 tablespoon of the reserved pasta cooking water. When everything is fully combined the egg mixture should be smooth and creamy. This is the base of the carbonara sauce.</li>
                <li>When both the spaghetti and guanciale are done cooking, add the noodles to the large saute pan along with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the hot pasta water. Then toss the noodles together with the guanciale and continue cooking for 1 minute over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>This is where the carbonara sauce magic begins to happen! First, turn off the heat and remove the saute pan from the stove. Then slowly pour the egg yolk mixture over the pasta while stirring continuously for 30 seconds with a wooden spoon. The residual heat of the pasta cooks the sauce as you stir.</li>
                <li>Once you have added the egg mixture, stir in the rest of the cheese along with 1 to 2 more tablespoons of the warm pasta cooking water to create a creamy consistency. Start with one tablespoon and then add more if needed. You want the pasta to be creamy, not watery.</li>
                <li>With the spaghetti carbonara complete, taste the finished dish. Then season with salt and pepper if necessary. Now, serve with your favorite wine and enjoy.</li>
